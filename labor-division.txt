CS230 Final Project: Ana Balcells, Ye Eun Jeong, Lucie Randall
Labor division
See comments in individual .java files for a method-by-method credit of authorship.

Ana:
* GraphPlusPlus class
- wrote constructors, clone(), dfsTraversal(), isConnected()
- debugged graph algorithms
* MainPanel class
- wrote helper method and ButtonListener subclass
* InputPanel class
- wrote constructor: created interactive components needed to make a graph from scratch or upload a .tgf file
- wrote and tested listeners for: radio buttons toggling different input methods; text fields, buttons, combo boxes, and file upload button for inputting vertices and edges; made "calculate" buttons that alternate in visibility depending on what graph option was clicked in the main panel
* OutputPanel class
- made and designed components that display results of a circuit/path test
- wrote helper methods to update labels in the output panel in order to display different content depending on what buttons were clikced in the Main- and Input panels.
* GraphPlusPlusGUI class
- designed the overall aesthetics of the interface
* drafted initial technical report

Ye Eun:
* GraphPlusPlus class
- wrote and tested vertexDegree(), isAllEvenDegrees(), isEulerian(), hasTwoOddDegrees(), hasEulerPath(), traverseEdges, traverseEdgesEP, traverseVertices, traverseVerticesHP, getEulerCircuit(), getEulerPath(), getHamiltonCircuit(),  getHamiltonPath(). 
* GraphPlusPlusGUI class
- wrote overall structure to tie in different classes together
- wrote switchPanel() method to switch between panels with click of buttons
* MainPanel class
- wrote constructor
* InputPanel class
- co-authored constructor and RadioListener subclass
- tested border cases and debugged code for listeners
* OutputPanel class
- wrote helper methods to update labels in the output panel to calculate and display results of circuit/path search
* drafted initial and final user's manual with design mockups and screen shots of demo

Lucie:
* GraphPlusPlusGUI class
- debugged GUI features
* drafted final Technical report
